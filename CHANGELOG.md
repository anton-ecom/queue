## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-28

### Added

#### Core Features
- **Adapter-First Architecture** - Pluggable queue backends with clean separation
- **Memory Queue Adapter** - In-memory queue for development and testing
- **Redis Queue Adapter** - Production-ready Redis-based queue (mock implementation)
- **Unit Architecture Integration** - Full consciousness-based design with teaching/learning
- **Job Management** - Complete job lifecycle with creation, processing, and monitoring

#### Queue Operations
- `add(type, data, options?)` - Add jobs with priority, delay, and retry options
- `process(type, handler)` - Register type-specific job processors
- `remove(jobId)` - Remove jobs from queue
- `getJob(jobId)` - Retrieve specific job information
- `getJobs(status)` - Get jobs by status (waiting, active, completed, failed, delayed)
- `getStats()` - Queue statistics and monitoring
- `pause()` / `resume()` - Queue control operations
- `close()` - Graceful shutdown and cleanup
- `isHealthy()` - Health check support

#### Job Features
- **Priority Processing** - Higher priority jobs processed first
- **Delayed Execution** - Jobs can be scheduled for future processing
- **Retry Logic** - Configurable retry attempts for failed jobs
- **Concurrency Control** - Configurable concurrent job processing
- **Job Status Tracking** - Complete job lifecycle monitoring
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error capture and reporting

#### Unit Architecture
- **Teaching Capabilities** - Queue can teach operations to other units
- **Learning Interface** - Ready for composition with other units
- **Help System** - Built-in documentation and examples
- **Runtime Validation** - Proper error messages and guidance
- **DNA Structure** - Proper unit identification and versioning

#### Developer Experience
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Comprehensive Tests** - 25 test cases covering all functionality
- **Demo Application** - Working examples for all features
- **Extensive Documentation** - README with examples and API reference
- **Error Validation** - Clear error messages for common mistakes

#### Testing & Quality
- **Memory Adapter Tests** - Complete test coverage for memory operations
- **Redis Adapter Tests** - Basic validation for Redis adapter
- **Unit Architecture Tests** - Teaching/learning capability validation
- **Error Handling Tests** - Validation error testing
- **Concurrency Tests** - Multi-job processing validation
- **Priority Tests** - Job ordering validation

### Technical Details

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Adapter Pattern** - Clean separation between queue interface and implementation
- **Provider-Specific Packages** - Future support for `@synet/cloudflare`, `@synet/nats`, etc.
- **Runtime Validation** - Focus on runtime error checking over compile-time complexity
- **Composition-First** - Teaching/learning paradigm for unit interaction

#### Dependencies
- `@synet/unit` v1.0.6 - Core Unit Architecture foundation
- TypeScript 5.8+ - Modern TypeScript support
- Vitest - Testing framework
- Biome - Linting and formatting

#### Performance
- **Memory Adapter** - Optimized for development with minimal overhead
- **Redis Adapter** - Designed for production scaling (mock implementation)
- **Concurrent Processing** - Configurable concurrency limits
- **Efficient Polling** - Smart polling intervals for job processing

### Documentation

#### Examples Added
- Basic queue setup with Memory adapter
- Production Redis configuration
- Job processing with error handling
- Priority and delayed job examples
